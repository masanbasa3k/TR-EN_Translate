# Translate Model Fine-tuning Project

This repository aims to apply fine-tuning to the T5-small model for translation between Turkish and English languages. The project is executed in a Google Colab environment. The chosen dataset for fine-tuning is the opus-100 tr-en dataset. After fine-tuning, the model is uploaded to the Hugging Face model hub for sharing.

## Usage

1. **Dataset:** The opus-100 tr-en dataset is utilized as the training data for the translation model.

2. **Fine-tuning:** The fine-tuning process is performed in the Colab environment.

3. **Hugging Face Integration:** The fine-tuned model is uploaded to the Hugging Face model hub for broader accessibility. You can find the model on the Hugging Face model hub at [masanbasa/my_awesome_opus_books_model](https://huggingface.co/masanbasa/my_awesome_opus_books_model).

4. **Testing:** After uploading to Hugging Face, the model can be downloaded and tested using the Hugging Face pipeline.

## Model Performance

The current performance of the model may be suboptimal as it has not undergone extensive training. However, it is anticipated that with sufficient training, the model will yield improved results. Alternatively, experimenting with larger models like T5-large instead of T5-small could potentially enhance performance.

Feel free to contribute, report issues, or provide suggestions to enhance the overall performance and functionality of the translation model.
